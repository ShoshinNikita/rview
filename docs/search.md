# Search

By default, `Rview` performs a fuzzy search on filepaths. The fuzziness is achieved
by splitting filepaths and search inputs to normalized words and generating prefixes
of various length for these words.

But sometimes you need more advanced tools to get relevant results. Fortunately, `Rview`
has something to offer:

- `"<exact match>"`: Double quotes allow to search for exact matches.
- `-"<exclude>"`: The minus before double quotes allows to exclude results
  that match the content inside these double quotes.

## Examples

**Files:**

- `animals/cute cat.jpeg`
- `animals/cat jumps.mp4`
- `animals/caterpillar.png`
- `animals/Cat & Dog play.mkv`
- `dogmas/catalog.zip`

**Search Requests:**

- `caterpillar` - search for filenames that have the same prefixes as `caterpillar` (`cat`, `cate`, `cater`, ...). Results:
  - `animals/caterpillar.png`
  - `animals/Cat & Dog play.mkv`
  - `animals/cat jumps.mp4`
  - `animals/cute cat.jpeg`
  - `dogmas/catalog.zip`
- `"caterpillar"` - search for filenames that have exactly `caterpillar`. Results:
  - `animals/caterpillar.png`
- `cat dog` - search for filenames that have the same prefixes as both `cat` and `dog`. Results:
  - `animals/Cat & Dog play.mkv`
  - `dogmas/catalog.zip`
- `cat dog -"zip"` - search for filenames that have the same prefixes as both `cat` and `dog`, but don't have exactly `zip`. Results:
  - `animals/Cat & Dog play.mkv`
- `-"dog" -"png" -"jumps"` - search for filenames that don't have exactly `dog`, `png` and `jumps`. Results:
  - `animals/cute cat.jpeg`
- `dog "/cat" -"mkv"` - search for filenames that have the same prefixes as `dog`, have exactly `/cat` and don't have exactly `mkv`. Results:
  - `dogmas/catalog.zip`
